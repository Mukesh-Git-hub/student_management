View All Students: Users can view a list of all students stored in the database.
Delete Student: Users can delete a student record from the database.
Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for building the application.
Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing built-in features for configuration, dependency management, and more.
Spring Data JPA: A part of the Spring framework that simplifies data access and manipulation using JPA (Java Persistence API).
MySQL: A relational database management system used to store student records.
JSP: A technology used for creating dynamic web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.
